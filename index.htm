Rifle Brigade was an old and well-respected regiment. Their training included
teaching their long history and encouraging the feeling of belonging so, when

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Unlike
most regiments, the Rifle Brigade did not have colours (a flag) as a rallying
point for the troops but used bugle calls instead. This tradition was based
around the idea that their troops would be dispersed when in action.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>They

passage to Africa as part of convoy WS10.</span></p>

WS10 (Winston Special 10) was made up of 19 troop and cargo ships and a number
of destroyer and cruiser escorts. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Having
left the Clyde, to avoid the U-boats, it would have travelled West across the Atlantic until it was about 100 miles from the East Coast of America. Then South down the
coast until it turned East again and back across the Atlantic to its first stop
at Freetown.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>After
about 36 hours, taking on supplies it went on to South Africa where, owing to
its size, it split with some ships going into Cape Town and others into Durban. Dad went into Durban where, during his stay, he was entertained to tea and cakes
by the Baptist Church who, on the 16<sup>th</sup> September 1941, wrote to his
family telling them he was OK. (<a

October 1941), he spent a number of weeks at Geneifa camp undergoing further

seems that the LRDG and SAS training camp was just down the road at Kabrit and
it was not unusual for men from their battalion to go there for a few days to
see if they were suitable (exiting from the rear of a truck whilst it was doing
30 mph was one of the things they learnt there).</span></i></p>

kill a man with your bare hands; how to escape when held at gunpoint by a man

only a boot lace. (When he showed me and I said  &#39you could break a mans arm
doing this &#39, his reply was  &#39we didn &#39t trouble about things like that &#39).</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>It
was usual for riflemen to stay from 2 to 6 weeks at Geneifa before being
allocated to an under-strength battalion and then travel to the Western front
by train. However, it seems from his pay-book, he underwent a Gas CAP test on
the 22<sup>nd</sup> Dec 1941 and as this would mean going into a chamber, it is
possible that he was still at Geneifa at that time.</span></p>

the line and on the 15th January 1942 started the move East, arriving at Beni
Yusef camp (not far from Geneifa), on the 26th January 1942. So maybe he stayed
at Geneifa waiting their return.</span></i></p>

time of his injury, he was in  &#39C &#39 Company, 10 platoon but it is possible that
he was with more than one platoon during his time with the battalion (It is
very likely that the platoons were restructured when they went into Italy, as
the battalion changed from a  &#39mobile unit &#39 to hard infantry and the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade was an extremely mobile unit and went into action
in many different guises. As a platoon, as a battalion, as part of the 7<sup>th</sup>
Motor Brigade or as a company (or part of a company) involved in a  &#39Jock &#39
Column.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>So,
unless the action was undertaken by the entire battalion, various parts of the
battalion could be in  &#39action &#39 at different places at the same time. Therefore,
without knowing which Company, Platoon and Section he was in, it is very
difficult to know where he was at any given time and the detail below is a
combination of fact and considered assumptions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>The
assumptions were based on the idea that at Kornine in March 1943, he was in  &#39C &#39
Company (C Coy) and when injured in July 1944, he was also in  &#39C &#39 Coy. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>Additionally,
a Corporal known as  &#39Pedlar &#39 is mentioned in letters written to him after the
war.  &#39Pedlar &#39 Gardner is also mentioned a number of times in a book called
 &#39Diary of a Desert Rat &#39 which was written by a rifleman in  &#39C &#39 Coy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>So
it is assumed he was always in  &#39C &#39 Coy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>At
the time of his injury in Italy, it seems he was in 10 Platoon, however when
the desert war was over and the battalion moved from North Africa to Italy, the
majority of their transport was taken away and they were changed from a mobile
motor battalion to  &#39hard infantry &#39. Instead of a Section truck, carrying 6 or 7
men and the items they needed on a day to day basis, they were transported in a
lorry that carried the entire platoon, with other vehicles carrying their
bedding etc. (They were allowed to keep a few Bren carriers).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><span style='font-family:Arial'>This
change from a mobile battalion to hard infantry, resulted in a re-structuring
of Platoons, so whilst it seems he was in 10 Platoon when in Italy, it is not certain which he was in when in North Africa.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:9.0pt'><i><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

some point, he was in the Kings Royal Rifles, although I have seen nothing to
support this and my memory may be failing me. (The KRRC were part of the 7<sup>th</sup>

1944, for political reasons, the Greek troops in North Africa rebelled. It is

troops and dealing with this mutiny before going to Italy.</span></p>

the 2<sup>nd</sup> May 1944 the vehicles that made the 2<sup>nd</sup> battalion
rifle brigade so mobile and effective in the desert war, were taken away (they
were left with a few carriers) and along with the 7<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup>

became a  &#39hard &#39 infantry unit which was associated with the 6<sup>th</sup>

pieces of shrapnel that had been removed from him in one of the many operations
that he underwent. I believe that from time to time he experienced, shrapnel
